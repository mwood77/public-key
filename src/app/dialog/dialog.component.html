            Depending on what installer you chose, you may get a user interface ("app"). 
            I'll only cover command line decryption here, 
            but most "apps" will only need you to double click the unlockable to access its content.

                Click the download button to get the keyfile, <code>@wmaw-public-key.gpg</code>, and place it at
                the same location as your unlockable.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're familiar with GPG, you can acquire it via the command line.

                Open your terminal (shell, bash, cmd, powershell, etc) and navigate to where 
                <code>@wmaw-public-key.gpg</code> and the unlockable are located. 
                Most terminals accept the <code>cd</code> command to change directories.

                We need to import my public key into your keychain. Type the following into the same terminal from step 2:

<pre class="code-block">
    gpg --import @wmaw-public-key.gpg
</pre>
            <p> 
                If you downloaded an "app," you can probably double-click the <code>@wmaw-public-key.gpg</code> file to import it.

                To decrypt the unlockable, enter the following into your terminal from step 2:
            </p>
<pre class="code-block">
    Take the following:
        NFT Name: "dip"
        NFT Type: png image (.png extension)
        Unlockable Name: "dip.sig"

    and fill in the [[ ]] parts of this command:
        gpg --output [[MAKE_UP_A_NAME]] --decrypt [[UNLOCKABLE_CONTENT]]

    Example:
        gpg --output dip.png --decrypt dip.sig
</pre>
            <p>
                After decryption you should see the message beneath in your terminal,
                and a new file created which matches the output name you specified.
